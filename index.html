            <p>You don’t have to be a Pokémon aficionado to recognize that the arrival of the feature-length, live-action “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” movie represents a major turning point to the cult of the franchise’s superfans: For those who grew up playing the video games, collecting the trading cards, or watching the Japanese anime series, and have been far from satisfied by the 21 feature-length cartoons to date, this is the big-screen validation of a childhood crush, in much the same way that a Michael Bay-directed “Transformers” movie or the Marvel Cinematic Universe cycle took the fantasy of what those properties represented to collectors and imagined how they might look in the real world.</p>
